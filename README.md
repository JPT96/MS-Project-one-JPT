# MS-Project-one-JPT

![](readme-screenshots/cw-designs-home.png)


for my first MileStone project I wanted to do something simple, that would also allow me to apply the lessons I have learnt in CSS and html modules.
So I created a portfolio website for a graphics designer.

## Why did i do this?

the reason why I went down this route is because it didn't require anything going on in the background, it helped my friend out, and also it allowed me to create transitions
whilst also working on layout. It created challenges that only a three page html project wouldn't in total this is 13 html files all linking in. Some with target blanks
and some without(I felt it was neccessary to create some that were active and sent you back to a original page such as portfolio.) This gave me a real world experience
as it involved me talking to a client whilst simaltaniously working towards assignment brief.

## my UX choices and my UI choices.

### UX justification. 
for my UX you can see this is almost primative and simple, this is justified for its purpose. As you can see it is very orange, this is on purpose as it is part of
the designers logo and signature, this is part of the designers identity. Which I feel gives it a real personal effect, this makes it stand out in the eyes of simple
stone wall grey background or white background etc etc add a thousand different designer portfolio pages they're all so similar. This is the oppourtunity to create something
personal and unique, another note on the personal side is by having a portrait picture of the artist front and center with a bio. This provides familiarity and sense of knowing
who it is you're working with, you know why you have searched up the artist so having the opening page as a bit about the artist really provides a sense knowing who and if this
artist is appropriate.

### UI Justification.
for my UI you can see that it has nice transitions, so although this may seem simple it does have nice touches to it including things like opacity fades and the nav bar
underlining itself but with a slight delay to create a nice feeling it makes it feel smooth and not ridged. throughout the website you'll notice I have independent pictures
of his portfolio, this allows the user to get a taste of what to expect from the website in question. I have alsp chosen these projects because it shows off the diverisity 
of the artists in question.

## Features.

Going over the features within my project, I have few features within my website these include things such as a contact section, a bio and a entire 11 html files dedicated to the
artists portfolio. Some features that have been pointed out and disscussed within the UI and UX section are the hover and active CSS elements I have added to improve both these
sections. A small feature I have added is simply taking out text decoration within the portfolio this tidys up the asthetic of the webiste whilst also acting as hyperlinks to
the specific locations. (Please note that the instagram and the Facebook links DO NOT lead to these pages listed as the designer does not have appropriate work related Social 
media. So instead it leads you to a youtube hyperlink to rick astleys never gonna give you up as it is a funny joke we still like to play between us also its a great song)

Another feature within the index page is that there is a video at the bottom of the page this is not related to the artist in anyway ( in fact it is me playing guitar.
this is only to fill in the LO that says you must add audio or video so I technically added both. This will not be left here in the future it is simply here to fullfill the 
purpose of the assignment brief.) The video has controls as well so it doesn't automatically play it is a MP4 meaning it can be used across all search engines. 

### Future Features

The future holds many posibilities and I want to come back to this project. Do I know all the changes I would like to make to this website? No, but there are a few things
I would like to change and update;
 
 * I would like to add the company logo as a background image behind every portfolio picture. 
 * I would like to add a interaction bar on either side of the webiste. 
 * I would like to actually impliment other langauges down the line to this project to make it more professional and ready for the real world

## Technologies used

For my technologies used it is very simple I used a library of images sent to me by the artist in question, language wise I only used HTML and CSS as outlined in the brief.

## Testing

For testing I went through a few things like the transition animations just to make sure that they all did the thing I wanted to do which was for each one to do it seperatley
This was hard as putting the correct "</div>" in the right place was everything as the transition was targetting a class that the portfolio was built around.
One issue I am still having is trying to seperate the Text from the portfolio image so that when the Image is hovered the Image fades out but I want the text to fade in
So that it is more clear where to click to go to the next page for the portfolio selected.

Testing out the "<a>" making sure that they were linked all to the right place was just a simple case of making sure that they were all leading to the right hyperlinks.
And that the hyperlinks were fullfilling the purpose set to them, and making sure the right ones had the target="_blank" and the right ones simply sent you back to either
 the portfolio, contact or home page. Whilst others lead to seperate portfolios, it quickly became apparent that for this website to work I couldn't incorporate thirteen target 
 blanks as having thirteen tabs open for one singular portfolio website is far too much.
 
 ## Deployment 
 
 For deployment I became easy to go from the coding platform I used to github-gitpod as I use VS code the only issues I really ran into was changing the file target locations within the gitpod as the gitpod won't have access to my C: drive so I need to make it target the files within the gitpod to make it all work appropriatley.
