    <p>Fighting Fit started of as an idea of a friend that I used for a final year project at college with the intention of becoming a martial arts and fitness brand in Exeter. This project has taken on several forms since the original design back in college as we have revisited it to keep it up to date for when the business gets up and running.  </p>
