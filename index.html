            ​<br>
            <br>
            I found my love of Graphic Design in secondary school and took my new found passion to the next stage by doing a Art & Design course at Exeter College. Here I focused on Graphic Design. Once I knew this was something I enjoyed, I focused on improving my skills and knowledge. The next stage was to push myself and go to Plymouth University. Here I found my ideas challenged more than expected but I'm glad this happened as it pushed my designs to the next level. 
            ​
            Now I have started my career in the commercial print industry, there has been so much more that I have learnt that has helped with my knowledge of the design industry grow. With the skills I have picked up working in a printers I now feel a lot more confident when it comes to designing for print and I'm able to adjust the design to fit better to a physical media.
            ​
            What's next? I am always on the look out for my next challenge and anything that takes me out of my comfort zone or can push my skills to the limit. Please spend some time looking though my portfolio and if you have a project or a job that you think can do this, don't hesitate and get in contact with me!
