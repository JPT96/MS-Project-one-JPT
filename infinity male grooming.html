    <p> Infinity is a local barber which the clients where very open to ideas that fitted within their theme of Peaky Blinders. So they wanted a more traditional look that looked like it came from the 1930's. The main design feature was the wooden block font to match the era and them I incorporated the barber pole and the infinity symbol to link everything back together.</p>
