    <p> The client for this brief came in with a very clear idea of what he wanted. The style wanted was very rustic farm stead pub look. They wanted the padlock as the main logo in a hand drawn newspaper style to fit their idea. The typography I had free range to pick a style I felt fitted with what the client was after.
