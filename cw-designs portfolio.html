    Project MARS is my longest personal project, this design adventure started when I was in college as a final year project. I have a massive love for space exploration and everything that comes with it. This project has now taken on many forms since the original design but has kept the same design ethic. As a project it has evolved with me and my design style as every time I look back at this project I see more ways I can improve upon my older work. This current iteration of Project MARS has been mostly logo based and designing with animation in mind.
