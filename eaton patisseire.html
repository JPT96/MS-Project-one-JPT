            Eaton patisseire, The Client wanted to have a redesign of their magazine advertisement page for their clients and suppliers. They where after a design that felt homely and hand made which their previous design did not. They where so happy with the first that in the end I ended doing their Christmas advert and a pull up banner they use at trade shows.
