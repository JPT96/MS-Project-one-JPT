    <p> Headland Finance was an interesting brief as I couldn't touch their logo or change the colours but they wanted to update all their literature and stationery as it hadn't kept up to date with modern trends. I went with a simple design style by using big images of the their local area to keep relevant to them. Also using a simple layout to keep it open and clean.
