    <p id="opener"> This University project was to commemorate an event in the past or future. At the time the 50th anniversary for the first moon walk was two years away. It was an easy choice as a topic because it is the start of most peoples passion for space. The idea behind the project was to have a series of 3 books, one for each member of the Apollo 11 mission. It was my first attempt at a book layout which was much more challenging than I had first thought. </p>
